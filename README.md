# Meeting Nopes!

Staying focused in meetings is difficult when you're also charged with taking
notes.

This little script creates a notes document based on an template, adds links to
issues from a Project board and opens a Pull Request.

## What it does

- TODO: Gets triggered by some event
  - Listen for Project events?
  - Run on a schedule?
  - How about a chatops command?
  - How do we deal with org level projects?
- Creates a markdown document, on a new branch, based on a template in a repository
- Pulls links and descriptions from any number of columns from a Project board
- Makes URLs out of the GitHub logins of the attendees
  - TODO: How does it know the attendees?
